                    <p>I grew up working with computers and playing video games, so When it came to understanding basic computer science I had a small advantage. Although most of my time was spent playing games I made YouTube videos, kind of embarrassing, however making videos and thumbnails taught me alot about graphics, process and vision.</p>

                    <div className='bio-started'>
                        <p>My first job I ever had was at a Catering company Catering By Design in Rochester MN. At the time I knew nothing of culinary arts and didn't expect the job to last long. However I ended up working there for 5 years (until I was 20) and became an excellent chef. I made everything from asian dishes, italian , indian, american, etc. At the time I was under the impression that food would be my life, I mean I loved it, I was good at it and because I was good at it I could make a decent living. Then all of a sudden the Discord-Music-Bot-Pocalypse struck due to YouTube giving out Cease and Desist letters to all the major music bots. I said to myself well that sucks we can't listen to music in our Discord calls anymore. Then I had a thought, JUST MAKE MY OWN. I had worked with computers all my life, and I had modified code before so it shouldn't be too hard. Man was I wrong. It was the most challenging thing I had ever done with computers. I built my own computer, diagnosed it whenever it had problems but nothing like that came close to the challenges I faced when coding my very own Discord-Music-Bot Smoothy, and you know what, I loved it. The hard process was fun for me, I also love the community that coding has, most everybody is so helpful and sincere. I then started posting my work on GitHub (y0Phoenix). Shortly after I made Smoothy I enrolled into a part-time coding bootcamp MIT xPRO Full Stack Development. I decided to pursue a career in programming, although I loved making food and I probably will forever, a tech job is more sustainable.</p>
